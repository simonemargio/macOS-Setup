<p align="center">The purpose of this list is to have a backup of my ideal macOS setup. This way I have a complete view of the programs I keep installed and possibly evaluate future changes. The list is public for those looking for programs and software for their macs.<br><br>ðŸ’° Paid - ðŸ”„ Subscription - âœ… Free</b>.<br><br></p>
  
## Browsers
#### Safari âœ…
For macOS it's the best browser you can have. Its optimization allows you to consume little and is fast and reliable.  

#### Firefox âœ…
Great alternative for those who don't want to use the default browser. I love its philosophy and it's cross-platform for any system.

## Communication
#### Telegram âœ…
I'm sure many prefer to use Signal for privacy or Whatsapp for not having it at all. I was lucky enough to take all my friends from Whatsapp to Telegram years ago and asking them to switch to Signal is too much. Telegram is excellent because it contains channels and groups for many passions and information.

#### Signal âœ…
Thanks to the tweet from [Elon Musk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1347165127036977153?s=20) and others, many people have started migrating to Signal, so I'm pushing harder to use it and delete Telegram.

#### Facetime âœ…
With telegram video calls I use Facetime less often, but it's a valid alternative for those who have the entire Apple ecosystem.

#### Microsoft Teams âœ… | ðŸ”„
Great for work and study. The only problem is that on macbooks it's not well optimized. On my macbook pro the fan starts at maximum and it gets very hot.

#### Apple music ðŸ”„
For Apple Watch owners this is the best choice. When I play sports, I avoid taking my phone with me. I've noticed that the music recommending algorithm has improved a lot lately, but still behind that of Spotfy.  
Apple watch + airpods + apple music is a must have.

#### Spotify âœ… | ðŸ”„
The interface is always the same, less refined than Apple Music. I don't like music and podcasts to be in the same application but I prefer to have them separate. For the rest he always recommends excellent music.

## Creative
#### Pixelmator Pro ðŸ’°
One of the few products that allow a single purchase without having to subscribe. I'm not a photographer so my use is pretty basic, but Pixelmator contains a multitude of features to be able to make so many changes to photos. I've also seen Affinity Photo but in my case the Pixelmator interface is much simpler.

## Media
#### VLC âœ…
Simple, free, open source. It does everything it needs to do smoothly.

#### Elmedia Video Player âœ… | ðŸ’°
More refined interface than VLC and complete support for devices with AirPlay, Chromecast and DLNA.

#### HandBrake âœ…
Open source video transcoder, never given any problems.

## Productivity
#### Axure RP 9 ðŸ”„
Fantastic software for creating and modeling prototypes. It allows the import of patterns and external libraries and the possibility to share your prototypes online.

#### PDF Expert ðŸ’°
Another product without any subscription to subscribe. It allows you to manage PDFs quickly and easily. Unfortunately, the iOS app is less curated and paid with a subscription.

## Security
#### 1Password ðŸ”„ | ðŸ’°
I've used many password managers but 1Password is still my choice. Multiplatform, it's not just web browser, password control, family sharing and many other features.

#### KeePassXC âœ…
Open source and totally offline password manager. In my case I use it to save backup codes and important documents that I want to keep separate from 1Password.

#### ProtonVPN ðŸ”„
I only use it in rare cases where I can't connect to a website.

#### Mullvad VPN ðŸ”„
One of the few VPNs that allow you to use it without having an account. Used for a couple of months and has never had any problems.

#### Suspicious Package âœ…
It allows you to analyze in detail all the .pkg packages before installing them. You can get information such as the files the package installs, running scripts, and more.

#### Little Snich ðŸ’°
The best firewall you can install. It allows you to block and create rules for any application and service on the mac.

## Backup
#### TimeMachine âœ…
He does everything, you don't have to do anything.

#### Carbon Copy Cloner ðŸ’°
Good backup manager with many features and in particular the possibility of checksum checks on the files being backed up.

#### Arq ðŸ’°
For offsite backups. It supports many services like Amazon S3, Backblaze B2, Google drive or cloud and many others.

## Utilities
#### AdGuard ðŸ”„ | ðŸ’°
Blocking and privacy protection software for blocking pop-ups, banners, and web tracking, malware and phishing. My advice is to wait for offers and discounts that allow you to purchase the lifetime license for a few dollars.

#### Sensei ðŸ’°
I recommend taking it if on offer at little for the lifetime version. Sensei is a set of features, you can have a general overview of your Mac (battery, ram, disks, fans, etc.), uninstall apps by searching through all the paths of the app in such a way as not to leave useless files, check the status of life of your disks, safely delete files you no longer need and much more.

#### coconutBattery âœ… | ðŸ’°
Detailed information on the battery of your devices such as MacBook and iPhone.

#### Cyberduck âœ…
It allows you to mount partitions such as: FTP, Azure, Amazon S3, Dropbox and many others.

#### DaisyDisk ðŸ’°
Check which files are taking up space inside your mac. Very simple and nice interface. Unlike other products, DaisyDisk allows you to go into the "depth" of each Mac path.

#### JDownloader2 âœ…
Download any file with a simple webpage link.

#### Keka ðŸ’°
Zipping and unzipping any file. Supports multiple formats.

#### qBittorrent âœ…
Download and manage torrent files.

#### Alfred âœ… | ðŸ’°
Spotlight is definitely a great way to search for anything. But many times it's slow, it doesn't show all the files and slowly. So you realize that it's limited. Alfred is a great replacement for Spotlight, light and fast. It's available in a free version but buying a license opens up a world of possible search combinations that you can do. Through the Workflows I can do research on Reddit, view my repo on GitHub, search for torrents and many other things. It has tons of features and once configured properly, I would just use it for anything.

#### Amphetamine âœ…
At first I was skeptical that my macbook turns off the screen or goes to sleep when I'm not using it, why should I use a program that always keeps it on? The answer is simple, there are situations such as: I have to download a file or a torrent, I have to be away from my Mac while has to perform processes, I'm performing backup operations and many others where my Mac must always be active and never go in suspension. Amphetamine allows you to configure this to your liking.

#### Magnet ðŸ’°
Magnet keeps your workspace organized. Activated by dragging, customizable keyboard shortcuts or via menu bar and declutters your screen by snapping windows into organized tiles. Fullscreen, halves, quarters & thirds. Up to six external displays supported. The potential combinations are endless.

#### Reeder ðŸ’°
Fantastic RSS feed manager. Available for both macOS and iOS. The latest update allows the synchronization of your feed via iCloud.

#### VMware Fusion âœ… | ðŸ’°
You can get a free license to use it for personal and non-commercial purposes. Excellent emulation and simple settings.

#### Kindle âœ…
For those who have a kindle it is an excellent app to be able to read their books and comics even on mac.

#### DevCleaner âœ…
If you use Xcode it allows you to see all the files downloaded for emulation and more. For example, many times there are installations of old iOS versions that can be deleted.

## Coding
#### Jetbrains suite ðŸ”„
The Jetbrains suite is immense. Each product is built for a specific language. There're already numerous settings and supporting software to work with your favorite programming language. On the other hand, they consume much more resources than other simpler and more reactive ide.

#### Atom âœ…
Fast and flexible. It can be configured in every detail to offer maximum power.

#### Sublime Text 3 âœ… | ðŸ’°
Configured properly it can be an excellent "ide" for development.

## Gaming
#### Steam âœ…
Let's say that if you go for gaming, perhaps it's not worth taking a mac. Many games emulate them with VMware Fusion or via Boot Camp. However, I have to admit that many of the games I like are compatible with macOS.

#### DOSBox âœ…
If you like old DOS games, this is the best emulator you can find.

#### OpenEmu âœ…
Open source emulator, supports many consoles such as: Atari, Nintendo, Sega, PSP, GameBoy and many others.

#### NVIDIA GeForce NOW âœ… | ðŸ”„
For the heaviest and most complex games. Allows you to link the Steam library. The only flaw for the moment is that the game catalog is still too little.

## Writing
#### Suite Apple (Keynote, Numbers, Pages) âœ…
It's like Microsoft's suite. It has Office compatibility and handles even complex spreadsheets well. Tip: if you rarely use Office, uninstall it from your mac and use the web brawser version, you save space and the infinity of installed Microsoft services.

#### MacDown âœ…
The best editor for Markdown. Simple, open source and fast. I recommend disabling the automatic preview update and using the cmd+r command to see the changes.

#### Apple Note âœ…
If you are in the Apple ecosystem it is a must have, both for fast and articulate notes.

# Setup

### Safari
Years ago I used a lot of extensions, now I have reduced them to the maximum. There're only two active extensions:  
- [1Password](https://1password.com/it/downloads/mac/)   
- [AdGuard assistant](https://adguard.com/en/adguard-assistant/overview.html#safari)

### Arq
I use iCloud as my main storage space but I have many other services with free storage that I don't use. Since Arq allows you to encrypt files before uploading them to the cloud, I managed my offline backups in the following way:  
- **Google Drive** (15GB): two accounts. Upload backups of my most important documents.  
- **Dropbox** (30GB): backup of all telegram chats from 2014 to today.  
- **OneDrive** (40GB): second backup over iCloud of important photos and videos.  

### Alfred workflows
- [GitHub repos](https://github.com/edgarjs/alfred-github-repos): allows you to quickly access all repos.  
- [Alfred Kat](https://github.com/godbout/alfred-kat): download torrents quickly without having to search anywhere on the internet.   
- [Reddit](https://github.com/deanishe/alfred-reddit): quickly browse Reddit subs and more.
